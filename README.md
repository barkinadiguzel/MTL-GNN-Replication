# MTL-GNN-Replication
MTL-GNN-Replication is a theoretical re-implementation of a multi-task learning framework built on graph neural networks for molecular property prediction. The goal is to faithfully translate the paper’s mathematical formulation and block-level architecture into clean, inspectable code without focusing on training or performance.
